### Purpose:
GGEngine is a general-purpose 2D game engine engineered from the ground up using Java, [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), and the [Box2D Physics Framework](http://box2d.org/).

### Motivation:
Giving back the ability to be creative as a game developer was the major issue I wanted to address when developing GuodGameEngine. Unlike modern day game engines that have predefined your developing experience to a cookie-cutter format, I wanted to give developers the option to create games that stray away from popular game genres. The logic behind this action stems from the ideaology of working within a closed system, prohibits the creative aspects to developing not just video games, but any art form. Allowing for developers to have a finite amount possiblities ensures that their is a finite amount of applicable creativity. Examples of this can be found in all general purpose game engines today such as [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4). Both Unity and Unreal are engineered to create generic gaming experiences, thus defining the opposite of what I aspire to create. 

With GuodGameEngine, the codebase was designed in such a way that it enables developers to be innovativate. Not only do I give the option for developers to work with generic tools, but I also allow for developers to take the predefined tools that I wrote, and build on top of them. Everything I wrote is abstracted to its most general form, always giving the developer to have more options. Ultimately, GuodGameEngine is a framework embodied as game engine, thus allowing for the artist to define their experiences - rather than a game genre. With this, I hope to push the creative elements of all game genres as well as the gaming industry forward as whole.
