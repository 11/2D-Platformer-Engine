3 am again, just like everyday, I regret what I stopped doing more than what I did wrong. I missed things that never happened.
I remember the possibility of experiencing once excited me, and now that time has passed, all that remains with me are smies, pleasant memories,
sounds, and smells. They say longing is the joy of being sad - I don't know whether to call this longing.

This is for all the times I didnt take a chance because of fear. This is for everything that could have been. This is also for everything
that was. For the times I didn't feel as alive as those who nearly died, but didn't.

4 am again, Going down my the trail of my daily exestianl thoughts. Am I still the same? And if not, a is that wrong? It's strange,
do you exist? What body does your soul in habit? Do I know you? Did I have you? Did I have you or will I have you? There are so many questions.
It rains and the music in the background is in align with what I feel.

5 am again, do I exist? Will I exist? Fuck ... I miss you.
